##  Business Objective

### Purpose
This application simplifies connecting HR departments, including headhunters, with individuals seeking IT jobs. It serves multiple functions:
- Enables Mega K students (referred to as "Students") to showcase their skills in a unified manner.
- Assists HR professionals in easily finding suitable job candidates, conducting interviews, and proposing collaboration.
- Allows administrators to manage access to the student database.
- Complements the job market, particularly for Mega K students, without directly competing with job portals.

### Business Model
- **Administrator Control**: Admins regulate access to the student database, thereby controlling the quantity of CVs downloaded by each HR user.

### Target Audience
- **Students**: Young programmers who are the central focus of the application.
- **HR Professionals**: Looking to hire IT talent.
- **Administrators**: Overseeing student database access and HR user management.

## Application Workflow

### Student Profile Management
- **Import and Registration**: Admins import a list of students from a CSV or JSON file. Each student receives a registration link.
- **Profile Completion**: Students fill in their profiles during or after registration, with certain fields being optional.

### HR Operations
- **Adding HR Users**: Admins add HR users, setting specific parameters. Post-registration, HR users view a table with partial student information.
- **Student Selection for Interviews**: HR can select students for interviews. Their capacity to add students to the "Interview" list is limited.A key feature for HR is an advanced filtering form that allows specifying student parameters such as course grades, preferred employment type, and expected salary.

### Interview and Hiring Process
- **Interview List Review**: HR has access to a "Candidates for Interview" tab. Each candidate's entry includes additional text and three action buttons.
- **Hiring Decisions**: Decisions made by HR are communicated to admins. Unselected candidates are returned to the available pool.

## System Roles

- **Admin**: Authorized to add HR users and import students. Assumes a singular role, manually added to the database with password management capabilities.
- **Student**: Completes and updates their profile, which is then accessible to HR for potential employment opportunities.
- **HR**: Works in HR or as a headhunter, accessing student profiles subject to settings and limits imposed by the admin.
